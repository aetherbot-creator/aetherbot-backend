# Final Fix for credit-aetherbot Not Found

## The Problem
Netlify dev server was caching the old admin.html file in memory, which had the old endpoint `/credit-Aetherbot` (capital A).

## The Solution
1. Updated admin.html to use lowercase `/credit-aetherbot`
2. Added cache-busting timestamp to the URL
3. **MUST restart the dev server** to clear memory cache

## Steps to Fix

### 1. Stop Current Server
In your terminal running the dev server, press **`Ctrl+C`**

### 2. Start Fresh Server
```powershell
npm run dev
```

### 3. Wait for Functions to Load
You should see:
```
â—ˆ Loaded function credit-aetherbot
```

### 4. Test in Browser
1. Go to http://localhost:8888/admin.html
2. **Don't use old tabs** - open a completely new tab
3. Login to admin
4. Click the **Snipe** button
5. It should now call `/credit-aetherbot` (lowercase) and work!

## Why This Happened
1. File was renamed from `credit-solsnipe.js` to `credit-aetherbot.js`
2. Admin.html was updated to call `/credit-aetherbot`
3. BUT Netlify dev server cached the old HTML in memory
4. Restarting the server clears the memory cache

## Verification
Check your server logs - you should now see:
```
Request from ::1: POST /.netlify/functions/credit-aetherbot
```
(lowercase 'a', not 'A')
